Hi let me first introduce myself. My name is Yash Agarwal (यश अग्रवाल, [y-uh-sh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJVVcVVbA4){:target="_blank"}). I am a junior at the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.nitc.ac.in){:target="_blank"}, [National Institute of Technology, Calicut](http://nitc.ac.in){:target="_blank"}. I love trying new operating systems, languages, programs, and pretty much everything remotely related to computers.

I have a wonderful family, my parents and a [brother](https://www.facebook.com/piyush.agarwal.9636468889){:target="_blank"}, and community where I belong to [Jaipur](https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-views-about-the-Pink-City-Jaipur){:target="_blank"}, India.

In my "spare time", I like walking alone, in random thoughts and sleeping. I don't have many friends cause I believe that I am very bad in judging people (for me, Prevention is better than Cure).

My current operating system is [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/){:target="_blank"} on [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}, a tiling window manager. But that isn't custom enough, so I started building my own operating system, using [(B)LFS](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/){:target="_blank"} project. Till now it has been a awesome experience, which has taught me more about Linux based operating systems, than most Linux enthusiasts learn in a lifetime.

Now that you know so much about me, [you should say hi!](https://twitter.com/theyashagarwal){:target="_blank"}

Have a good day...:)
