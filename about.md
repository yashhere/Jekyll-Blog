Hi let me first introduce myself. I am Yash Agarwal, a junior at the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.nitc.ac.in), [National Institute of Technology, Calicut](http://nitc.ac.in). I love trying new operating systems, languages, programs, and pretty much everything remotely related to computers.

I made this blog from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I don't consider myself a reinvent the wheel kind of guy, but I like to explore the things.

My current operating system is Arch Linux on openbox, a tiling window manager. But that isn't custom enough, so I started building my own operating system, using (B)LFS project. Till now it has been a awesome experience, which has taught me more about linux based operating systems, than most linux enthuasiasts learn in a lifetime.

My only motive in creating this blog was so that I could provide answers to some questions that I had trouble finding the answers to.

Have a good day...:)
