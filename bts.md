Welcome to my blog!
===================

Currently under construction, this website is supposed to be a place to share my experiments with Computer Science and my experience with life. I use this website for several purposes

- General info about me for people who are curious
- A place to publish things I discover, my personal thoughts, and silly rants.
- A venue for practice new things Iâ€™m learning

This blog is a summary of my learning process. It also serves the purpose of helping people with similar issues as I had. I wish this blog could witness every step I take towards becoming a great, and help many others to grow and make progress with me.
