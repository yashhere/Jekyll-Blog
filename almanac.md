### **Software**
I was introduced to the world of Linux and open source in my college. After that I have never looked back. Here is some of the tools which I frequently use:

- Vim: cause I don't like using mouse.
- tmux: terminal multiplexer.
- terminator: A terminal for geeks.
- zsh: Instantly awesome Zsh using Prezto.
- Sublime Text: Vim is not great as and IDE.
- Grunt: Development is not easy without this.


### **Gaming**
I am a big fan of Tomb Raider Series, Need for Speed Series and action adventurous games. Although I try to control myself from regular game playing, once I start, It's only after I finish the game, I start other works.

### **Studies**
Although I am not very sincere about studies these days, in exam times, cramming becomes my best friend. In college, I lost my interest in studies cause I found more interesting things to do. 

### **Co-curricular**
I am a executive at Industrial & Planning Forum at my college. Truly speaking, I am not very active there. Apart from that, I am Lab Admin at Software Systems Lab, at CSE Department of my college. This is the work, I love most. Linux server configuration and python scripting is my current love.
