### **Software**
I was introduced to the world of Linux and open source in my college. After that I have never looked back. Here is some of the tools which I frequently use:

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/): cause I don't like using mouse.
- [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/): terminal multiplexer.
- [terminator](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Terminator): A terminal for geeks.
- [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/): Instantly awesome Zsh using [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): Vim is not great as and IDE.
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Development is not easy without this.


### **Gaming**
I am a big fan of Tomb Raider Series, Need for Speed Series and action adventurous games. Although I try to control myself from regular game playing, once I start, It's only after I finish the game, I start other works.

### **Studies**
Although I am not very sincere about studies these days, in exam times, cramming becomes my best friend. In college, I lost my interest in studies cause I found more interesting things to do. 

### **Co-curricular**
I am a executive at [Industrial & Planning Forum](https://www.facebook.com/ipfnitc) at my college. Truly speaking, I am not very active there. Apart from that, I am Lab Admin at [Software Systems Lab](http://athena.nitc.ac.in/), at CSE Department of my college. This is the work, I love most. Linux server configuration and python scripting is my current love.
